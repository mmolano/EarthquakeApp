### MainActivity

Show a *Spinner* element with choices for earthquakes magnitudes:
- Significant Earthquakes
- M4.5+ Earthquakes
- M2.5+ Earthquakes
- M1.0+ Earthquakes
- All Earthquakes

When we click on the **Maps** button we have to change the activity to **MapsActivity** and display markers for earthquakes (of selected magnitude).

When we click on the **List** button we have to change the activity to **ListActivity** and display a list of earthquakes (of selected magnitude).

### ListActivity

List earthquakes depending of the value received in "Extra message".

When an item is clicked (not long pressed), we have to change the activity to **MapsActivity** and display only one marker (latitude, longitude and title of the clicked row).

### MapsActivity

Show earthquakes on map depending of the value received in "Extra message".
